# Have you ever wanted to learn SQL?! 

May I suggest [HackerRank!](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)
HackerRank is a technology hiring platform that is the standard for assessing developer skills for over 3,000+ companies around the world.

Also, they provided resources to learn SQL as well as many other coding languages commonly used in tech position!

Once you feel prepared enough, you can get certified as I have, to further demonstrate your coding abilities!
